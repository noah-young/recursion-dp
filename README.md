### Recursion and Dynamic Programming Solutions

#### king.cpp
Takes dimensions of a chess board from the user and determines the number of paths a king can take from the first file to the last.
```
Enter board dimensions for the king's path: 8 8

Paths from first to last file: 11814
```
#### training.cpp
Takes a distance in miles for a race from the user. Recursively finds all the different ways a runner could break the distance up in intervals.

```
For 5 miles:

Day 1: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
Day 2: 1, 1, 1, 2
Day 3: 1, 1, 3
Day 4: 1, 2, 2
Day 5: 1, 4
Day 6: 2, 3
Day 7: 5
```
```
Enter the distance of the race in miles: 5 

Length of training schedule: 7 days.
```
